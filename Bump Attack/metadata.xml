    <description>• Passive
• Avoid contact damage from weak enemies, and kill weaker enemies on touch
• Can give Paper Isaac transformation
• Repentance and multiplayer support

When you have this item, all enemies with a max health of &lt;= 0.65x your DPS will turn yellow and not deal contact damage. All enemies with a max health of &lt;= 0.5x of your DPS will turn green, and you can kill them just by touching them. Doing this also gives a few frames of invincibility, meaning you can safely bump-kill enemies that explode upon defeat. It's a great defense against kamikaze-like enemies or enemies that spit out weak flies/spiders!

You can change the effectiveness of this item (specifically, the health amounts) with Mod Config Menu. DPS is simply (damage * tears/second), not accounting for items that fire multiple tears, have a chance of firing more powerful tears, etc. If you have any balancing recommendations, feel free to comment below.
