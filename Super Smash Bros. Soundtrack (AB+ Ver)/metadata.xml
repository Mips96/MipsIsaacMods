This is a carefully-curated pack featuring music from the Super Smash Bros. series. Most of it consists of Smash originals (e.g. Final Destination, Multi-Man Melee), but there are several official remixes as well (e.g. Brinstar Depths, Great Temple). A full track list can be found below, or as a spreadsheet [url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-6i1juoNblVoJ6VdiPkW-RBTrcEWS9OB58RIciNiZnk/edit?usp=sharing]here[/url].

All of the music in this pack loops as it should. I tried to get a good variety of songs from all five games, though there ended up being a lot of Brawl music and not much 64/SSB4.
