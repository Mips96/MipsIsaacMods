Dark Restock restocks items bought from Devil rooms and black markets, and drops three random pickups upon getting it (just like normal Restock). It also restocks items spawned by the Shady Pass.

By default, the Lost/Tainted Lost/Tainted Jacob (ghost) is limited to one Devil room or black market restock/floor to prevent an easy win, but this can be changed with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1603631350]Mod Config Menu[/url] to 0-5 or unlimited restocks/floor. You can also reduce the number of pickups dropped (0-3) to match Repentance's Restock nerf.

If you want Restock and Dark Restock combined into one item, I also made a mod called [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1825512255]Restock+[/url] that does just that.
