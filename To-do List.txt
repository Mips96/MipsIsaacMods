Dark Restock
- "PostUpdate" failed: line 106: attempt to index a nil value (upvalue 'player')
	- Only does this during the first run after the game is opened
- Item currently spawns three random pickups; make this a toggle (disabled by default)
- Only works if player 1 has Dark Restock
- Does not work if A Pound of Flesh is active (should restock devil room item)
- Tainted Jacob's ghost form can get infinite items

Restraining Order
- "PostUpdate" failed: line 136: attempt to index a nil value (upvalue 'player')
	- Only does this during the first run after the game is opened
- Angel room chance increase only works if player 1 gets Restraining Order

Unfixable(?) Bugs:

Bump Attack, Chill Out, Close Call
- These items cannot prevent losing Holy Mantle (Holy Mantle activates before the MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DMG callback is attempted)

Spike Shield
- Spiked rocks pierce Spike Shield (I don't think there's a way to uniquely distinguish this entity through the damageSource since it's a GridEntity)



Other Known Bugs:

Shady Cell Phone, Shady Pass
- These items are untested and probably don't work at all in Repentance; I may come back and test/fix them in the future, but they're the first mods I ever made, the code is messy, and I suspect they'll be some of the most difficult to fix.
