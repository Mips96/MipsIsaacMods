    <description>â€¢ Repentance only (the original version can be found [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2551214017]here[/url], for AB+ players and people who preferred the original tracklist)

This is a carefully-curated pack featuring music from the Super Smash Bros. series. Most of it consists of Smash originals (e.g. Final Destination, Multi-Man Melee), but there are several official remixes as well (e.g. Brinstar Depths, Great Temple). A full track list can be found below, or as a spreadsheet [url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-6i1juoNblVoJ6VdiPkW-RBTrcEWS9OB58RIciNiZnk/edit#gid=1893903508]here[/url].

All of the music in this pack loops as it should. I tried to get a good variety of songs from all five games, though there ended up being a lot of Brawl music and not much SSB4.

This mod requires the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1933285222]Soundtrack Menu[/url].

Also, it's recommended (but optional) that you download the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2489123309]Isaac's Parents Don't Fight mod[/url], which removes the Ascent voice clips (they just don't fit well with the new music).
