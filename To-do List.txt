Add quality for the following items:
- Shady Cell Phone
- Shady Pass



Unfixable(?) Bugs:

Bump Attack, Chill Out, Close Call
- These items cannot prevent losing Holy Mantle (Holy Mantle activates before the MC_ENTITY_TAKE_DMG callback is attempted)

Spike Shield
- Spiked rocks pierce Spike Shield (I don't think there's a way to uniquely distinguish this entity through the damageSource since it's a GridEntity)



Other Known Bugs:

Shady Cell Phone, Shady Pass
- These items are untested and probably don't work at all in Repentance; I may come back and test/fix them in the future, but they're the first mods I ever made, the code is messy, and I suspect they'll be some of the most difficult to fix.

Transformation API
- This mod does not have proper multiplayer support, and Repentance support may be a little dodgy. But Repentance itself added transformation tags to item XMLs and makes this mod completely redundant anyway.

Restock+ and Dark Restock:
- Picking up A Pound of Flesh makes these items useless.
