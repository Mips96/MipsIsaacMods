• +1 black heart
• Spawn a single black market deal in the starting room of every floor

The Shady Pass is the black market's calling card, and it brings the market to Isaac by offering a single black market deal in the starting room of each floor. This means each starting room sells one item from the Shop pool at the cost of a heart container, which counts as a Devil deal. It also synergizes with the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1825502490]Shady Cell Phone[/url], which can restock the Shady Pass's spawned item if it has already been bought. Picking up the Shady Pass also gives 1 black heart.

This item spawns in the Demon Beggar, Curse, and Secret Room item pools.

The Shady Pass works on every floor except The Chest/Dark Room, where the black market is inaccessible.

(Note: There is a visual bug where rerolling an item spawned by the Shady Pass may turn the item into a heart pickup for one frame. This is only visual and does not affect gameplay.)</description>
