• Take double damage. That's it.
• Can give Paper Isaac transformation

This is a (more or less) objectively bad joke item based on the Paper Mario badge of the same name. All it does is double the damage you take. But it also counts toward the Paper Isaac transformation, so it's not [i]completely[/i] bad.
