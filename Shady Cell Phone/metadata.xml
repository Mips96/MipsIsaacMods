Isaac has a direct line to the black market, and they'll help in whatever way they can... for a fee.

The Shady Cell Phone is a 6 room charge active item that spawns a single black market deal (as in, one item from the Shop pool is on sale for a heart container and counts as a Devil deal). It also restocks the Shady Pass's spawned item if you already bought it.

Since the black market is inaccessible in The Chest/Dark Room, the Shady Cell Phone gets bad reception on those floors and doesn't work.

(Note: There is a visual bug where rerolling an item spawned by the Shady Cell Phone may turn the item into a heart pickup for one frame. This is only visual and does not affect gameplay.)
