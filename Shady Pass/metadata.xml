• +1 black heart
• Spawn a single black market deal in the starting room of every floor
• Repentance and multiplayer support

The Shady Pass is the black market's calling card, and it brings the market to Isaac by offering a single black market deal in the starting room of each floor. This means each starting room sells one item from the Shop pool at the cost of a heart container, which counts as a Devil deal. It also synergizes with the Shady Cell Phone, which can restock the Shady Pass's spawned item if it has already been bought. Picking up the Shady Pass also gives 1 black heart.

The Shady Pass works on every floor except The Chest/Dark Room, where the black market is inaccessible.

(Note: There is a visual bug where rerolling an item spawned by the Shady Pass may turn the item into a heart pickup for one frame. This is only visual and does not affect gameplay.)
