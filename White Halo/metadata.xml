    <description>• Trinket
• Angel rooms can still spawn after defeating a boss, even if a Devil deal has already been taken
• Repentance and multiplayer support

This trinket makes it so that a Devil room may be replaced by an Angel room upon defeating a boss, even if you've already taken a Devil deal. This only affects spawn rates upon clearing a floor, [i]not[/i] through getting to one of the two rooms through other means (Joker card, red chest, etc).

(Technical note: In the API, you can't force the Angel room chance to anything below 100%, so whether or not you'll get an Angel room is decided when you enter the boss room with this trinket. For example, if you should have a 75% Angel chance, it will start at 0 and have a 75% chance of suddenly shooting up to 100%. Same outcome, just a weird-looking execution).</description>
